The following is fix for multi MCU sync issues, usually an error will happen when homeing, and you will see something like this.

"Communication timeout during homing probe"

This fix has worked on multiple machines running the SKIPR with the THR36 board in USB Mode, I have not tested this with CAN, it may work, but Im not interested in testing as I see no real reason to run CAN on my machines.

To fix the sync home issue with multi MCU follow these instructions:

Type the following: sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/klipper.service

Add the follow under the [Service] section:

CPUAffinity=3

Save: Hold down the ctrl key and pres x, then follow the promts

Then type: sudo systemctl restart klipper

And Roberts your Fathers Brother, no more issues.
